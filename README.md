# libaatm

This software is a repackaged version of the Alma Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves Tools.  The original upstream code came from this git repository:

https://bitbucket.sco.alma.cl/projects/ASW/repos/telcal/browse/TelCalResults/Libraries/ATM

The git version of that source is recorded in the VERSION text file in this current directory.

This library uses a cmake build system...
